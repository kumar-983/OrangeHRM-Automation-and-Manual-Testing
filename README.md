## Selenium Automation

The Selenium Automation suite automates all 32 test cases developed during manual testing.

### Automated Modules
- Login
- Logout
- Forgot Password
- Input Validation
- Session Validation
- Navigation
- UI Verification

---

## Defect Management

All identified defects were reported and tracked using Jira.

Defects were manually identified through testing, then logged to Jira using a Claude + Jira (MCP) integration to speed up documentation — each entry was manually reviewed for accuracy.

Activities performed:
- Bug creation
- Severity assignment
- Priority assignment
- Status tracking
- Defect documentation

---

## Agile Scrum Methodology

This project follows Agile Scrum practices:
- Requirement Analysis
- Sprint Planning
- Test Case Design
- Test Execution
- Defect Reporting
- Regression Testing
- Sprint Review

---
